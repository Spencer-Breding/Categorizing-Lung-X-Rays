# Classifying Lung X-Rays

This project trains a convolutional neural network to classify lung x-rays as either healthy or pneumonia afflicted.

## Note
You will require a Kaggle Username and API key in order for the Notebook to automatically download the dataset. You can still manually download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia if you wish, but if you do this make sure to place it in the correct directory.
