# Identifying Pneumonia in Lung X-Rays by Spencer Breding and John Bower

This project trains machine learning models to identify lung x-rays into one of two categories: healthy or pneumonia afflicted.

## Note
Please run all IPYNB files using Google Colab.
Also, please note that you will require your own Kaggle Username and API key in order for the code in Spencer's Model to automatically download the dataset. You can still manually download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia if you wish, but if you do this make sure to place it in the correct directory.
